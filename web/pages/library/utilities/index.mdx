# Icon Library

## Utilities

Adding icons to the default library is easy.  In these examples we'll keep it
simple and assume that you've got an icon that is defined by a single `path`
element.  We'll also assume that it's a stroked path rather than a filled
path.

If you're not sure what that means, or if you've got a more complex icon that
you want to include then the
<Link to="/library/data-format" text="data format"/> page describes the
various different ways you can specify icon data.

## `addIcon()`

The `addIcon()` function can be used to add a single icon to the default
library.  The first argument is the icon name, the second is the icon
definition.  For simple icon paths like the one we're using in this example,
you can specify just the path data (the `d` attribute from the `path`
element).

You can then use the icon by specifying the name, either by itself or with any
additional modifiers or CSS classes.

<Example
  Component={AddIcon}
  code={AddIconSrc}
  expand
/>

## `addIcons()`

The `addIcons()` function can be used to add multiple icons to the default
library.  The only argument is an object in which the keys are the icon names
and the corresponding values are the icon definitions.

<Example
  Component={AddIcons}
  code={AddIconsSrc}
  expand
/>
