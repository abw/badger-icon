# Icon Library

## Integration

If you've create a custom icon library then you need to know how to integrate
it so that the <Link to="/icon" text="Icon"/> component can access the icons.

## The `library` Property

The quick and simple approach is to pass your icon library data to the
component via the `library` property.

<Example
  Component={IconIcons}
  code={IconIconsSrc}
  expand
/>

## A Custom Component

It can get a bit tedious having to add the `library` property every time you
use the `Icon` component.  Another approach is to define your own icon
component that is a wrapper around it and injects the `library` property for
you.

You can call it anything you like.  In this example, we create a new `Icon`
component which is a wrapper around the original `Icon`, imported as
`BadgerIcon`.  Just remember to import *your* `Icon` component when you use it
instead of the default one from `@abw/badger-icon`.

<Example
  Component={Custom}
  code={CustomSrc}
  expand
/>

## Theme Provider

Another approach is to use the theme provider to automatically inject the
`library` property into the `Icon` component.  This uses <ReactOneLouderLink/>
as the theming engine.

Import the `Theme` component and then enclose your app (or part of it) in a
`Theme.Provider` element.  This would usually be done somewhere near the "top"
of your application. For example, if you're using <ViteLink/> then the
`main.jsx` (or `main.tsx`) would be the usual place.  For a <NextLink/> app,
you could add it to the
<Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app" targetBlank text="_app.js"/>.

The properties added to the `Theme.Provider` should include an `Icon` object
including any properties that you want to automatically inject into the `Icon`
component.  In this case, we want to set the `library` to reference our custom
library.

That's all you need to do.  Now you can use the standard `Icon` component
anywhere in your app and it will automatically receive the `library` property
for your custom icon library.

You can also use the theme provider to inject properties into any other
components in your application.  You just need to make a one-line change to
the exported value for the component to wrap it with the `Themed` higher order
component.  See the <ReactOneLouderLink/> documentation for further details.

<Example
  Component={Theme}
  code={ThemeSrc}
  expand
/>
