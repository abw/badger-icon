# Icon Library

## Data Format

The icon data format is designed to keep the library as small as possible,
wherever possible.

The `icons` are defined as a Javascript object where the keys are the icon
names and the corresponding values are the icon data for that icon.

## Minimal Example

For simple icons that are composed from a single filled path you can define an
icon to be a string containing the path data.

<Source
  code={Minimal}
  language="json"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Width and Height

The default size for the SVG view box for the icon is 512 units wide and 512
high.

512 is 16 x 16, so when displayed at the default size of 16px, each unit in
the source SVG coordinate system is 1/16th of a display pixel.  Or to put it
another way, an icon displayed at a font size of 16rem will be 512px wide and
512px high and each unit in the SVG source will equate to 1 display pixel.

One benefit of this is that we can round coordinates to the nearest integer
without any noticeable loss of precision.  An icon displayed at a size of
16rem (512px x 512px) will be pixel perfect. An icon displayed at 32rem
(1024px x 1024px) will have coordinates that are no more than 1 pixel out.

Of course, you don't have to round your coordinates to the nearest integer,
but doing can significantly reduce the size of the path data.  For example,
a coordinate of `123` is 3 bytes, compared to `12.34` which is 5, and they
have a similar precision.

If your icon uses a different width and height then the icon can be defined
as an object specifying the `width` and `height`.  If either is omitted then
we assume it is 512.  The path data can be set using the `path` property.

<Source
  code={WidthHeight}
  language="json"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Type

The `type` property can be set to define the basic icon type.  This defaults
to `fill` which sets the `fill` color to `currentColor`.

You can also set it to `line` for stroked icons.  This will set the `fill` to
`none` and the `stroke` to `currentColor`.

<Source
  code={Type}
  language="json"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

As a shortcut you can prefix the path data with the type, separated by a
colon.

<Source
  code={TypePrefix}
  language="json"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Modifiers

The `type` property can include any number of modifiers to set the style
and/or transforms.  It is equivalent to setting the
<Link to="/icon/type" text="type"/> property when rendering an icon.

You can also define multiple modifiers in the prefix to a simple path.

<Source
  code={MultiType}
  language="json"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Style

The `style` property can be used to define styling for the icon.  It is
equivalent to setting the <Link to="/icon/style" text="style"/> property when
rendering an icon.

It can be provided as a string or object.

<Source
  code={Style}
  language="json"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>
