# Icon Library

The default icon library provides some of the most commonly used icons as well
as a number of icon component that can be composed to make more complex icon.
At some point you'll probably want to add some different icons to the library,
or create your own library from scratch. There are a number of ways you can do
this.

If you just want to add a few icons to the existing library and don't mind
getting your hands a little dirty, then you can use the
<Link to="/library/utilities" text="utility functions"/> to do that.

You'll need to have a least a cursory understanding of the
<Link to="/library/data-format" text="data format"/> used for icons.

If you want to generate your own custom library then you can use
<Link to="/library/badger-icon-tools" text="badger-icon-tools"/> to
do so.  You can include any of the 200,000 open source vector icons available
through <IconifyLink/> and import icons from your
own SVG files.

If you create your own icon library then you'll need to know how
to <Link to="/library/integration" text="integrate it"/> so that the
<Link to="/icon" text="Icon component"/> can access the icons you've
defined.
