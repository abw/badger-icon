# Icon Library

## Badger Icon Tools

The `@abw/badger-icon-tools` library provides a simple way to build your own
icon library.  You can include any of the 200,000 open source vector icons
available through <IconifyLink/>, import icons from your own SVG files, or
hand craft icon components if that's your thing.

There's a separate website dedicated to using `@abw/badger-icon-tools` (or
soon will be - it's still a work in progress as I write this).

The end result is that you'll end up with your own icon library in a
Javascript file that you'll need to patch into the
<Link to="/icon" text="Icon"/> component.
