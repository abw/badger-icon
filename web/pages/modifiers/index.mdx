# Modifiers

Modifiers provide an easy way to alter the basic style of an icon or transform
it to change the orientation, size or position.

Multiple modifiers can be added to an icon
<Link to="/icon/name" text="name"/>.  Each should be separated by a hyphen.
Modifiers can also be specified using the <Link to="/icon/type" text="type"/>
property.

<Icons
  names="arrow arrow-thin arrow-thick arrow-right arrow-down arrow-left-thick"
/>

## Parameters

Some modifiers are simple words (e.g. `flipy`) and others can take parameters.
These can be specified using `=` or `:` (e.g. `rotate=45` or `rotate:45`).
Parameters can include periods (i.e. numerical values with a decimal point)
and negative values.  As long as the minus sign follows immediately after `=`
or `:` then it is interpreted as part of the value rather than a modifier
separator.

The `left`, `right`, `up` and `down` modifiers can be used without a parameter
to change the orientation of the icon, or with a parameter to move it within
the view box.  Or you can use both in the same icon name to both rotate the
icon and move it.

<Icons
  names="arrow-rotate=45 arrow-opacity=0.4 arrow-shrink=6 arrow-shrink=6-down=4 arrow-rotate=-45"
/>
<Icons
  names="arrow-right.border arrow-right-right=2.border arrow-right-right=4.border"
/>

## Case Sensitivity

Icon names are case sensitive and by convention are usually lower kebab case
(e.g. `foo-bar` rather than `foo_bar` snake case or `fooBar` camel case).
But if you're defining your own icon library then you can name then any way
you like, as long as you reference them using the same case.

In contrast, modifier names are NOT case sensitive.  They are all defined in
lower case but you can reference them in upper or mixed case and they will be
converted to lower case for matching.  For example, `-flipy`, `-flipY` and
`-FlipY` are all treated the same as `-flipy`.

<Icons
  names="arrow-flipy arrow-flipY arrow-FlipY"
/>
