# Modifiers

## Stroke Width

The `strokeWidth=NN` modifier can be used to set the stroke width to any
arbitrary amount.

If you dont't specify a unit for the value then it is assumed to be in 16ths
of the icon size.  For a 1em (16px) icon, this corresponds to pixel units.
This is usually the best approach as it doesn't depend on you knowing the view
box size of the original source icon SVG.

<Icons names="arrow-strokeWidth=1 arrow-strokeWidth=2 arrow-strokeWidth=3"/>

## Pixels and Points

You can also specify the stroke width using `px` or `pt` units, although these
will depend on the size of the view box for the original SVG source icon.  For
example, if the icon was specified with a view box sized 24px by 24px then a
stroke width of 1px will be 1/24th of the total size.  However if the view box
was 64px by 64px then it will only be 1/64th.

<Icons names="arrow-strokeWidth=12px arrow-strokeWidth=24px arrow-strokeWidth=48px"/>

## Percentage

The final option is to specify the stroke width as a percentage. According to
the SVG specification: *"A percentage value for stroke width is always
computed as a percentage of the normalized viewBox diagonal length"*.  For a
square icon, a stroke width of 4.42% corresponds to 1/16th of the icon height,
or 1px for an icon displayed at a size of 1em / 16px. This is the multiplying
factor used when you specify a stroke width without any units (e.g.
`strokeWidth=1` is the same as `strokeWidth=4.42%`).

<Icons names="arrow-strokeWidth=4.42% arrow-strokeWidth=8.84% arrow-strokeWidth=13.26%"/>
