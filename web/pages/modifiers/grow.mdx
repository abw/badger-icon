# Modifiers

## Grow

The `grow=N` modifier can be used to increase the size of the icon content.
Each number corresponds to 1/16th of the icon size, e.g `grow=8` will increase
the size by 50%.

Note that this scales the icon content inside the view box, but does not
change the display size of the icon.  However, content may overflow and be
visible outside the normal bounds of the icon.
