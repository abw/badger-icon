# Icon

## `name`

The `name` property can be used to select an icon from the default icon
library.

<Example
  Component={Name}
  code={NameSrc}
  undent={2}
/>

## Modifiers

You can add <Link to="/modifiers">modifiers</Link> to the end of an icon name
to change the style, size, orientation or position of an icon.  Each should be
separated by a hyphen.

For example, the `right` modifier rotates an icon through 90&deg; so that it's
pointing to the right, the `thicker` modifier sets a thicker stroke width, and
so on.

<Example
  Component={Mods}
  code={ModsSrc}
  undent={4}
  expand
/>

## CSS Classes

You can add CSS classes to the end of an icon name to have them added to the
icon.  Each should be separated by a period. Classes should be added after any
modifiers.

Classes can contain hyphens (e.g. `shadow-2`) and modifier parameters can
contain periods (e.g. `opacity=0.5`). The first period in an icon name is
*usually* treated as the start of a list of classes *unless* it appears
immediately before a number.  Thus, the period in `0.5` is treated as part of
the number and does not indicate the start of the classes section.  Hyphens
are used to separate modifiers *before* the first period marking the start of
the classes section.  After that, periods are used to separate classes and
hyphens can be safely included in class names.

<Example
  Component={Classes}
  code={ClassesSrc}
  undent={4}
  expand
/>

## Icon Composition

The `name` property can contain a number of different icon names, including
modifiers and/or CSS classes.  Each should be separated by one or more
whitespace characters.

The icons will be composed into a single stacked icon.

<Example
  Component={Names}
  code={NamesSrc}
  undent={4}
  expand
/>

## Name Tokenisation Example

Here's an example to help clarify how a complex name is tokenised.

<div>
  <div className="smaller">Name</div>
  <div className="flex">
    <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-5 shadow-2">
      <span className="red fgc-50">arrow</span>-<span className="orange fgc-50">rotate=-45-opacity=0.4</span>.<span className="yellow fgc-50">x2.shadow-2</span><br/>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div className="flex start gap-4 stack-laptop mar-t-4">
  <div>
    <div className="smaller red fgc-50 fgd-60">Icon</div>
    <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-5 red shadow-2 mar-b-4">
      arrow
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="mar-b-4">
    <div className="smaller orange fgc-50 fgd-60">Modifiers</div>
    <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-5 orange shadow-2 mar-b-4">
      rotate=-45-opacity=0.4
    </div>
    <div className="flex start gap-4 stack-tablet">
      <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-3 orange shadow-2 mar-b-4">
        rotate=-45
      </div>
      <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-3 orange shadow-2 mar-b-4">
        opacity=0.4
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <div className="smaller yellow fgc-50 fgd-60">Classes</div>
    <div>
      <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-5 yellow shadow-2 mar-b-4">
        x2.shadow-2
      </div>
    </div>
    <div className="flex gap-4 stack-tablet">
      <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-3 yellow shadow-2 mar-b-4">
        x2
      </div>
      <div className="large font-mono border pad-v-2 pad-h-4 surface-3 yellow shadow-2 mar-b-4">
        shadow-2
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Working from right to left, the CSS classes start at the first period
that isn't immediately before a number.  That rules out the period
in the value of `0.4` for `opacity`.

So the CSS classes start just after that, with `x2` being the first
CSS class.  The CSS classes are then split on periods, giving us
`x2` and `shadow-2`.

Everything before that point is then split on hyphens, excluding
any that come immediately before a number.  So the hyphen in
the `-45` value for `rotate` is treated as a
minus sign rather than a delimiter.  The result is that this part is
split into three tokens: `arrow`, `rotate=-45`
and `opacity=0.4`.

The icon name is the longest leading subset of those components that
matches a name in the icon library.  In this case it's just
`arrow`, but you can have an icon name with hyphens in it,
e.g. `arrow-alt`, and the algorithm will use that for the
name.

Any tokens remaining after the icon name has been resolved
are assumed to be modifiers.  In this example, that's
`rotate=-45` and `opacity=0.4`.
