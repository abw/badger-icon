# Icon

## `path`

The `path` property can be used to define the data for an SVG path.

In most, if not all cases, you would define this in your icon library and
refer to it by <Link to="/icon/name" text="name"/>.  But this gives you an
insight into how things work behind the scenes.

In simple terms, specifying an icon by name causes the component to lookup the
path for that icon and substitute it in here.  Any modifiers or CSS classes
are also converted into lower level properties that can be passed directly
to the component (e.g. `className`, `style` and `transform`).

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  undent={4}
  expand
/>
