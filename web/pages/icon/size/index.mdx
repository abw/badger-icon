# Icon

## `size`

The default view box for an SVG icon is 512px wide and 512px high. The `size`
property can be used to set both the width and height to a different value.
Note that this only affect the resolution of the internal coordinates used in
paths and does not change the dimensions of the displayed icon.

The default font size for an icon is 1em.  In this example the `x3` CSS class
is added to set the size to 3em, along with the `border` class to add a 1px
border.  So the total icon height is 50px (assuming 1em = 16px, so 3em x 16px
= 48px + 2px border).

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  undent={4}
  expand
/>

## `width` and `height`

The `width` and `height` properties can also be used to set the view box width
and height if you want to use different values.  Note that the `height` of the
displayed icon will always be the same, regardless of the internal view box
coordinates.

As in the previous example, the `x3` CSS class is used to set the icon font
size to `3em`.  However, setting a different value for `width` *will* change
the displayed width.  In this example the width is twice that of the height
(32 vs 16), so the displayed icon width will be `6em` wide (96px) plus 2px for
the border, for a total of 98px.

<Example
  Component={WHComponent}
  code={WHSource}
  undent={4}
  expand
/>
