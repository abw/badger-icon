  The precise details on how you import the CSS will vary depending on what
  framework and bundler you're using.  For a React app using Vite or running
  under Next.js, for example, you can add the CSS file to your main

  For other frameworks and/or bundlers you should consult the documentation on
  how to import a CSS file from a module in your `node_modules` directory.
