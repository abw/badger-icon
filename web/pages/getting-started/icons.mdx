# Default Icons

This module provides a flexible mechanism for rendering icons but it isn't
really intended to be a fully-fledged icon library. Some basic icons are
included as a starting point. In most cases you'll want to define your own
icon library including only the icons that you want to use in a project.

Note that there's only one of each basic icon.  There isn't an explicit
`arrow-right` icon defined, for example, because specifying `arrow-right`
as an icon name will use the `arrow` icon and apply the `right` modifier to
rotate it to point to the right.

<Icons names={Object.keys(Library.icons)}/>
