## `polyline`

The `polyline` element is used to creates straight lines connecting several
points. Typically a polyline is used to create open shapes as the last point
doesn't have to be connected to the first point. For closed shapes see
the <Link to="/primitives/polygon" text="polygon"/> element.

The explicit form is to define the icon as an object with the `element`
property set to `polyline` and an additional property for the `points`. Any
other properties can be included as attributes for the generated SVG
`polyline` element.

<MDNElementLink element="polyline"/>

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  expand
/>

The short form of this is an object with a `polyline` property which is a
string containing the `points`.

<Example
  Component={Short}
  code={ShortSrc}
  expand
  undent={2}
/>

The even shorter form is to define the icon as a string with the `polyline`
prefix, a colon, and then the `points`.

<Example
  Component={String}
  code={StringSrc}
  expand
  undent={2}
/>
