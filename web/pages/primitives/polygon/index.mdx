# Primitives

## `polygon`

The `polygon` element defines a closed shape consisting of a set of connected
straight line segments. The last point is connected to the first point.

The explicit form is to define the icon as an object with the `element`
property set to `polygon` and an additional property for the `points`. Any
other properties can be included as attributes for the generated SVG
`polygon` element.

<MDNElementLink element="polygon"/>

<Example
  Component={Component}
  code={Source}
  expand
/>

The short form of this is an object with a `polygon` property which is a
string containing the `points`.

<Example
  Component={Short}
  code={ShortSrc}
  expand
  undent={2}
/>

The even shorter form is to define the icon as a string with the `polygon`
prefix, a colon, and then the `points`.

<Example
  Component={String}
  code={StringSrc}
  expand
  undent={2}
/>
